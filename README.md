# trackerBlaster
## Purpose and Design principle
This application is a generalized tracker-manager web application for randomizer games. It is intended to be lightweight and universally operable.

The goal of the design is to run entirely on the front end, storing necessary data clientside in cookies/session data so that the user can either view it at site or view it locally, but persistent long term session data will persist the necessary details.

Remaining Lightweight and simple is the point.

I am one person and this is a personal project, so I make zero promises of any kind whatsoever.

## Wishlist
Long term, it would be nice to have this application integrate with a separate user-management system that can tie data in without trouble.


## Compatibility
I intend to make this compatible with the games that I like to play, but theoretically anyone who lays hands on it can modify it to add compatibility as desired.

## Contribution
Open issues, open forks against them if you feel like it.


## Hosting this application
Heroku provides the ability to run simple web applications for free up to a certain amount of bandwidth. Given that the application is static, it can also be run on S3 or anything else capable of serving static files.
I intend to host it using a github pages tool or something similar. Feel free to host your own if you feel like it, but know that I make no guarantees or promises. Leave me out of it.
